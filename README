===Description===
Visualize is a music visualization template written in Processing.  The goal is leverage the accessibility of Processing to allow the easy development of intricate, music-reactive visuals.  The program currently uses Minim to do audio analysis and then outputs visuals that have parameters based off of the FFT spectrum.  It also utilizes themidibus (http://smallbutdigital.com/themidibus.php) to allow for the use of midi controllers to manually control visuals.  As is, Visualize serves as a low-cost VJ toolkit that can produce professional-quality visuals.

Note that the framework here in under heavy construction; however, I thought it was better to get it out sooner than later for other people to play with while I clean up the code and try to make it more modular.

The visualizer is currently set up to be controller with a KORG nanoKONTROL; however, you can use the nanokontrolTest.pde to map any midi controller.  Just run the nanokontrolTest.pde in Processing, and in the standard output you'll see a list of midi controllers.  Substitute your controller's name in 'myBus', and run the program again.  Whenever you press a button on your midi controller, Processing spits out the mapping for you.  Then just map to your heart's content!
