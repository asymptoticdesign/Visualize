===Description===
pyInstrumentation is an object-oriented library for connecting to serial, usb, and rs232 busses with python programs.  The code is meant to be written in an simplistic and straightforward way to help even non-programmers connect to their instrumentation for automated data analysis and acquisition.

This project is similar to pyVISA, but my goal is to produce something that is simpler in complexity (though less powerful 'out of the box'), easyu to learn, and extremely customizable.

===Dependencies===
Python 2.6
Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib

===List of Compatible Hardware===

====Microcontrollers====
Arduino UNO

====Function Generators====
Agilent 33210A

====Oscilloscopes====
Agilent DSOX2004A
